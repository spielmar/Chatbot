xbee routingWhat do I do?| Make sure you have the correct COM Port selected, ensure the XBee is oriented the correct direction, verify that the interface is working properly by removing the XBee and bridging pins 2 and 3 (DIN and DOUT) of the XBee socket, and use X-CTU (Legacy Version 5.2.8.6) to perform a deep recovery of the XBee. Set the baud rate to 9600, select the XBee type you are working with, select the Function Set "ZIGBEE ROUTER AT", check "Always Update Firmware", and click Write. You may need to press the reset button multiple times during this process. If the "Action Required" prompt appears more than twice during this step or does not go away, then it is likely that the modem is unrecoverable. If you are using a third-party interface board, you must bridge the Reset pin (Pin 5) and ground (Pin 10) with a pushbutton. When a step indicates to press the reset button, this implies that Reset pin (Pin 5) of the XBee has been shorted to ground (Pin 10).|Mon Nov 06 2023 15:03:25 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)
